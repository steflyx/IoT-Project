# Keep your distance! - IoT-Project

This project was developed together with Gianluca Guarro as part of the IoT class at Polimi. 

We were asked to build an IoT application that would warn users whenever two motes are too close to each other (similarly to what *Immuni* does).
We built two versions, one that considers for each mote a different user (so each user is going to be warned every time he gets closer to another mote) and one
that considers a single supervisor who's warned whenever two motes get too close to each other (use case would be a store owner who gives a mote to any client who enters the store).

A live demonstration can be found on YouTube [at this link!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cu4VAJeTB1Q&t=2s)
